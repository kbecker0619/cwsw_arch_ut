# CWSW Event Queue component

This is the Test folder for the Event and Event Queue components.

This folder is not intended to provide a full environment for testing with a demo application; we really don't want to drag in all of the other components upon which this component depends

Any unit testing that is evident here, is done with NetBeans v8.2, with CUnit support. CUnit is installable in Cygwin, so within that environment, we use the Cygwin compiler chain.
